## Design Choices

### Fonts
For the main text I have chosen Gill Sans as I feel it is has a clear, simple and easy yet fun to read. Bold and Cursive has been used to elevate the text.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, social media links. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I will be using a light gray-white colour on the background(#efefef) to make the website a little more soft looking, while the images will help making it feel warmer also. The text color used for headers is warm Red(RGB #170, 0, 0) and Black(#000000), while most of the paragraphs is using Black(#000000) and White(#ffffff).

# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It The content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.
\
&nbsp;

I have encountered several issues during testing. 
 + I initially decided to create the site with a minimum width of 992px as my largest styling, however the site just did not look right so added an x-large screen size.

 + In my wireframes, I had designed to only have a 'Join Us' button on the larger screen sizes. While I was developing the site, this did not make sence. There was such a long scroll with it being a one-page site, I felt I needed to speed up the movement for someone who was instantly interested so included it on all screen sizes.

 + On actual smaller devices, instead of on Chrome Developer, the main navigation menu did not show the 'Contact' link. I simply changed the styling of the links and the changed the ul to flex-start and all is now clearly visable.

 + I was having issues with the navigation bar scrolling about 15px when I scrolled down on smaller devices whilst working on Chrome Developer. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out the issue, but when I tried the site on an acual device, the navigation bar stayed fixed as the code dictated. This was a bug in Chrome Developer and not with my site.

 + The main navigation on smaller devices was initially set to 90vh, however on testing on a physical device, the user could see the site scrolling at the bottom if they were to slide up or down. This looked very poor and clumsy on the eye, so I adjusted it to 100vh to cover it up.

 + I found that I was repeating alot of code in my style.css file in order to center items. I created a class to do this and then applied it whee needed.

 + All my buttons were styled completly differently. I added an animation to all buttons so there is a continuity between them all.

 + When I was validating HTML code, I had one error showing. This was in the contact form where I had a method of '#'. I was under the understanding that POST method should have been used, but when I did, it caused an error instead of going to my contact.html page. After a while I tried using GET and it worked solving my validation problem. The results of my validation for HTML and CSS are below.

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (contact.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-contact-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes/css-validate.JPG "W3C CSS")
\
&nbsp;

 + On testing on a physical mobile device, I thought that the google search bar looked odd, being white and my header a dark colour. For user experiance and to make it look cleaner and more fluid, I changed the colour to match using the following code.

 ```

 <meta name="theme-color" content="#121A18">


 ```

 + When going through my UX section, to ensure that all my goals were met for the project, I noticed that I had missed one, 'As a user, I want to know that the club is well established'. I adjusted the text in the welcome section to suit.
\
&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs

My learning has limited my use of the hamburger for smaller devices. It works nicely to open the menu up, but a tap of the hamburger again should close the menu down again. It does not do this, and the link has to be selected to enable the user to exit out of it. From my research it seems that all the streamline methods are using JavaScript and I am yet to learn this.
