## Design Choices

### Fonts
For the main text I have chosen Gill Sans as I feel it is has a clear, simple and easy yet fun to read. Bold and Cursive has been used to elevate the text.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, social media links. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I will be using a light gray-white colour on the background(#efefef) to make the website a little more soft looking, while the images will help making it feel warmer also. The text color used for headers is warm Red(RGB #170, 0, 0) and Black(#000000), while most of the paragraphs is using Black(#000000) and White(#ffffff).
