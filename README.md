## Design Choices

### Fonts
For the main text I have chosen Gill Sans as I feel it is has a clear, simple and easy yet fun to read. Bold and Cursive has been used to elevate the text.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explanation needed to their meaning, social media links. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I will be using a light gray-white colour on the background(#efefef) to make the website a little more soft looking, while the images will help making it feel warmer also. The text color used for headers is warm Red(RGB #170, 0, 0) and Black(#000000), while most of the paragraphs is using Black(#000000) and White(#ffffff).

# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It The content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.
\
&nbsp;

I have encountered several issues during testing. 

 + Initially used px for text, but it didn't follow proportions during screen resizing. I learned to use double reset for responsive text and easier calculation of rem sums.
 + Had trouble centering navbar with text-align center, so changed div to flex display with justify content set to center. 
 + Wanted 2-column, aligned picture layout for "Latest Recipes" section. Solved it using flex display.
 + Made pictures interactive with animation using hover pseudoclass and changing transition time and opacity.
 + Tried using FontAwesome icons, but CSS link didn't work. Found alternative from W3Schools, but some icons have outdated design. 
 + Learned during testing the validator, certain rules/guidance applies, such as sections must contain headers among them.
 
    - HTML (index.html) validator [results]!(assets/images/readmeimg/valid_index.jpg) "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (recipe.html) validator [results](assets/images/readmeimg/valid_recipe.jpg) "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (gallery.html) validator [results](assets/images/readmeimg/valid_gallery.jpg) "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes/css-validate.JPG "W3C CSS")

HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator?
CSS:  No errors werre returned when passing through the oficial (Jigsaw) validator?
